Sizes reduces the time it takes to evaluate all of our apps possible device sizes, orientations and font combinations. With Sizes we'll avoid launching all the supported devices simulator, running our app and navigating through each screen manually which not only takes a lot of time but its also highly error prone since we sometimes forget to test one particular combination and we ship a screen with a layout bug to the App Store.

## üåü Features

- [x] Inspect your app in multiple device sizes
- [x] Switch orientations
- [x] Test all font sizes
- [x] Universal (iPhone & iPad)

### üí° Demo

To run the demo project, clone the repo and run `Sizes` target.

## üì≤ Installation

#### Using [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org)

Edit your `Podfile` and specify the dependency:

```ruby
pod 'Sizes'
```

#### Using [Carthage](https://github.com/carthage)

Edit your `Cartfile` and specify the dependency:

```bash
github 'marcosgriselli/Sizes'
```

## üë©‚Äçüíª How to use

### Preparations

Sizes require you to use [Auto Layout]((https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AutolayoutPG/)) in order to update the UI correctly with each change.

For font updates you'll need to use [Dynamic Type](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/visual-design/typography/).

**Programmatically:**

```swift 
let label = UILabel()
label.font = UIFont.preferredFont(forTextStyle: .headline, compatibleWith: traitCollection)
label.adjustsFontForContentSizeCategory = true
```

**IB/Storyboard:**

### Setup

In order to use Sizes you'll need to make your `AppDelegate's` rootViewController an instance of `SizesViewController` and contain the apps first view controller.

```swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
    let root = SizesViewController()
    let navigation = UINavigationController(rootViewController: ViewController())
    window.rootViewController = root
    root.contain(viewController: navigation)
    window.makeKeyAndVisible()
    return true
}
```

‚ö†Ô∏è This might not be the ideal solution for all cases since it will require you to set the root view controller manually. Or if you're accessing the apps root view controller from many places this approach will clash with it.

‚ö†Ô∏è I recommend you only use this while on `#DEBUG` mode

I'm open to exploring new solutions to this issue + ways of setting this up on Storyboards.

### Usage

Shake to display the Sizes configuration UI, then tap on one of the orientation/device options to trigger a change. Or update the Text size slider to navigate through the different font sizes, you'll get the font name as you slide.
